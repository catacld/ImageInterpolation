PROXIMAL INTERPOLATION

We look for the nearest known point and approximate the function's value at this point. For each pixel of the new image, two interpolations
are applied on the OX axis and the OY axis to find the nearest point of the old image.

BICUBIC INTERPOLATION

Bicubic interpolation uses cubic splines on two dimensions. The 16 transformation coefficients of the new image
are calculated using a system of equations where the values of the function, the values of the derivates with
respect to x and y and the values of the mixed derivative are known.
